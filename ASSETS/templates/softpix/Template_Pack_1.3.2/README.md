# SPX Template Demo Pack 1.3

> Updated 2022-06-10


This starter pack consists of a few example HTML -templates to be used for testing [**SPX Graphics Controller**](https://www.github.com/TuomoKu/SPX-GC/) for controlling HTML-based graphics in [CasparCG](https://casparcg.com/), [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), [Wirecast](https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/), [vMix](https://www.vmix.com/) and much much more.

<BR>

> Custom made and branded templates should always be used in production but these might help while getting to know the system. If you need **Creative Services** for designing and developing custom templates, please [get in touch with SPX Creative Services](https://spx.graphics/contact).

## Installation
 - Install **SPX Graphics Controller** from [spx.graphics](https://spx.graphics) if not installed.
 - This template pack comes with the software, so no additional installations are needed. 
 - in SPX, open a project and add templates into it
 - open any rundown in that project and add templates to rundown.
 - fill in the templates and play.

 > When developing templates please see the **source files** for additional comments, instructions and links to external docs (such as [SPX Knowledge Base](http://spxgc.tawk.help)) or libraries.

## List of templates
The pack has the following templates to demonstrate various capablities of SPX Graphics Controller. Each template has a `theme` selector to choose between different visual packages. 
| Template | Features |
| ------ | ------ |
| BUMPER | Bumper or  "a stinger" was created in After Effects and converted to SPX template with StreamShapers Ferryman.<br>Uses `none` as out-mode. |
| INFO LEFT / RIGHT | Template has a `filelist control` for choosing an animated lottie-icon from a local folder. |
| NAME LEFT / RIGHT | Name strap (lower third) with optional fields. |
| TICKER RSS | Dynamic ticker uses Javascript logic to load content from RSS source using SPX's feedproxy API endpoint.|
| TICKER EXCEL | Dynamic ticker uses SPX's Excel reader functionality to load content from a local Excel file.|
| TITLE 2 STEPS | Animation has two phases: `play` > `continue` > `stop` using the `step: 2` property. |

> â„¹ Remember, these templates are **just simple examples** what can be done, but there are limitless possibilities when using HTML for creating graphics: images, videos, SVG-animations, CSS transforms, graphs and charts, maps, API connections, canvas element, WebGL and much much more!

## SPX Template Definition
Each template has a Javascript configuration object to expose desired features and default values to SPX. See SPX documentation for details.

Example configuration for a simple 1 field text template:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.SPXGCTemplateDefinition = {
        "description": "One liner",
        "playserver": "OVERLAY",
        "playchannel": "1",
        "playlayer": "8",
        "webplayout": "8",
        "out": "manual",
        "uicolor": "3",
        "DataFields": [
            {
                "field" : "f0",
                "ftype" : "textfield",
                "title" : "Simple text strap",
                "value" : "Firstname Lastname"
            }
        ]};
</script>
```

## Customization options 
Each template has a **visual theme** CSS selector. The CSS files define fonts and colors for each element in the templates. You can duplicate CSS files in the `themes` subfolder. Once the SPX UI is reoaded, it will list all the CSS files in that folder and those can be assigned to each rundown item.

Some examples below:

**Remember**, these customizations only effect some visual aspects of these demo templates. Animations and layout stays mostly the same. For production purposes a custom made template pack is _the way to go_. [Get in contact](https://spx.graphics/contact) if you need help in creating bespoke templates with advanced features (social media integration, impactful animations, responsive "linked" layers, image galleries, map animations, graphs, particle effects etc...)
